<h3><b>Chapter</b> 1</h3>
1 Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and <b>Timothy</b> our brother,

To Philemon our beloved fellow <b>worker</b> 2 and <b>Apphia</b> our <b>sister</b> and <b>Archippus</b> our fellow <b>soldier</b>, and the <b>church</b> in your <b>house</b>:

3 Grace to you and <b>peace</b> from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4 I <b>thank</b> my God <b>always</b> <b>when</b> I <b>remember</b> you in my prayers, 5 because I <b>hear</b> of your love and of the faith that you have <b>toward</b> the Lord Jesus and for all the saints, 6 and I <b>pray</b> that the <b>sharing</b> of your faith <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>effective</b> for the <b>full</b> <b>knowledge</b> of <b>every</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> that is in <b>us</b> for the sake of Christ. 7 For I have <b>derived</b> much <b>joy</b> and <b>comfort</b> from your love, my brother, because the <b>hearts</b> of the saints have been <b>refreshed</b> through you.

8 <b>Accordingly</b>, <b>though</b> I am <b>bold</b> <b>enough</b> in Christ to <b>command</b> you to do <b>what</b> is <b>required</b>, 9 <b>yet</b> for love’<b>s</b> sake I <b>prefer</b> to appeal to you—I, Paul, <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> and now a prisoner <b>also</b> for Christ Jesus— 10 I appeal to you for my <b>child</b>, <b>Onesimus</b>, <b>whose</b> father I <b>became</b> in my imprisonment. 11 (<b>Formerly</b> he was <b>useless</b> to you, but now he is <b>indeed</b> <b>useful</b> to you and to me.) 12 I am sending him back to you, sending my <b>very</b> heart. 13 I would have been <b>glad</b> to <b>keep</b> him with me, in order that he might <b>serve</b> me <b>on</b> your <b>behalf</b> <b>during</b> my imprisonment for the <b>gospel</b>, 14 but I <b>preferred</b> to do nothing <b>without</b> your <b>consent</b> in order that your <b>goodness</b> might <b>not</b> be <b>by</b> <b>compulsion</b> but of your own <b>accord</b>. 15 For this <b>perhaps</b> is <b>why</b> he was <b>parted</b> from you for a <b>while</b>, that you might have him back <b>forever</b>, 16 <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother—<b>especially</b> to me, but <b>how</b> much more to you, <b>both</b> in the <b>flesh</b> and in the Lord.

17 So if you <b>consider</b> me your <b>partner</b>, receive him as you would receive me. 18 If he <b>has</b> <b>wronged</b> you at all, <b>or</b> <b>owes</b> you <b>anything</b>, <b>charge</b> that to my <b>account</b>. 19 I, Paul, write this with my own <b>hand</b>: I will <b>repay</b> <b>it</b>—to say nothing of your <b>owing</b> me even your own <b>self</b>. 20 <b>Yes</b>, brother, I <b>want</b> <b>some</b> <b>benefit</b> from you in the Lord. <b>Refresh</b> my heart in Christ.

21 <b>Confident</b> of your <b>obedience</b>, I write to you, <b>knowing</b> that you will do even more than I say. 22 At the <b>same</b> <b>time</b>, <b>prepare</b> a <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> for me, for I am <b>hoping</b> that through your prayers I will be <b>graciously</b> <b>given</b> to you.

23 <b>Epaphras</b>, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, <b>sends</b> <b>greetings</b> to you, 24 and so do <b>Mark</b>, <b>Aristarchus</b>, <b>Demas</b>, and <b>Luke</b>, my fellow <b>workers</b>.

25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your <b>spirit</b>.
