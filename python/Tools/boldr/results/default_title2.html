<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

Paul, a <b>servant</b> of God and an <b>apostle</b> of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God’s <b>elect</b> and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with <b>godliness</b>, 2 in hope of eternal life, which God, who <b>never</b> <b>lies</b>, <b>promised</b> <b>before</b> the <b>ages</b> <b>began</b> 3 and at the <b>proper</b> time <b>manifested</b> in his word through the <b>preaching</b> with which I have been <b>entrusted</b> by the command of God our Savior;

4 To Titus, my true child in a <b>common</b> faith:

Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

5 This is why I <b>left</b> you in <b>Crete</b>, so that you might put what <b>remained</b> <b>into</b> order, and <b>appoint</b> <b>elders</b> in every <b>town</b> as I <b>directed</b> you— 6 if <b>anyone</b> is above reproach, the <b>husband</b> of one <b>wife</b>, and his children are <b>believers</b> and not <b>open</b> to the charge of <b>debauchery</b> or <b>insubordination</b>. 7 For an <b>overseer</b>, as God’s <b>steward</b>, must be above reproach. He must not be <b>arrogant</b> or <b>quick-tempered</b> or a <b>drunkard</b> or <b>violent</b> or <b>greedy</b> for gain, 8 but <b>hospitable</b>, a <b>lover</b> of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and <b>disciplined</b>. 9 He must <b>hold</b> <b>firm</b> to the trustworthy word as <b>taught</b>, so that he may be <b>able</b> to <b>give</b> <b>instruction</b> in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who <b>contradict</b> it.

10 For there are <b>many</b> who are <b>insubordinate</b>, <b>empty</b> <b>talkers</b> and <b>deceivers</b>, especially those of the <b>circumcision</b> <b>party</b>. 11 They must be <b>silenced</b>, <b>since</b> they are <b>upsetting</b> <b>whole</b> <b>families</b> by teaching for <b>shameful</b> gain what they <b>ought</b> not to teach. 12 One of the Cretans, a <b>prophet</b> of their own, <b>said</b>, “Cretans are always <b>liars</b>, evil <b>beasts</b>, <b>lazy</b> <b>gluttons</b>.” 13 This <b>testimony</b> is true. <b>Therefore</b> rebuke them <b>sharply</b>, that they may be sound in the faith, 14 not <b>devoting</b> themselves to <b>Jewish</b> <b>myths</b> and the <b>commands</b> of people who <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> from the truth. 15 To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and <b>unbelieving</b>, nothing is pure; but both their <b>minds</b> and their <b>consciences</b> are defiled. 16 They <b>profess</b> to <b>know</b> God, but they <b>deny</b> him by their works. They are <b>detestable</b>, disobedient, <b>unfit</b> for <b>any</b> good work.

But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine. 2 Older men are to be <b>sober-minded</b>, <b>dignified</b>, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in <b>steadfastness</b>. 3 Older women likewise are to be <b>reverent</b> in <b>behavior</b>, not <b>slanderers</b> or slaves to much <b>wine</b>. They are to teach what is good, 4 and so <b>train</b> the <b>young</b> women to love their husbands and children, 5 to be self-controlled, pure, <b>working</b> at <b>home</b>, <b>kind</b>, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be <b>reviled</b>. 6 Likewise, <b>urge</b> the <b>younger</b> men to be self-controlled. 7 Show <b>yourself</b> in all <b>respects</b> to be a <b>model</b> of good works, and in your teaching show <b>integrity</b>, <b>dignity</b>, 8 and sound <b>speech</b> that <b>cannot</b> be <b>condemned</b>, so that an <b>opponent</b> may be put to <b>shame</b>, <b>having</b> nothing evil to say about us. 9 <b>Bondservants</b> are to be submissive to their own <b>masters</b> in everything; they are to be <b>well-pleasing</b>, not <b>argumentative</b>, 10 not <b>pilfering</b>, but <b>showing</b> all good faith, so that in everything they may <b>adorn</b> the doctrine of God our Savior.

11 For the grace of God has appeared, <b>bringing</b> <b>salvation</b> for all people, 12 <b>training</b> us to <b>renounce</b> <b>ungodliness</b> and <b>worldly</b> passions, and to <b>live</b> self-controlled, upright, and <b>godly</b> <b>lives</b> in the <b>present</b> <b>age</b>, 13 <b>waiting</b> for our <b>blessed</b> hope, the <b>appearing</b> of the <b>glory</b> of our <b>great</b> God and Savior Jesus Christ, 14 who <b>gave</b> himself for us to <b>redeem</b> us from all <b>lawlessness</b> and to <b>purify</b> for himself a people for his own <b>possession</b> who are <b>zealous</b> for good works.

15 <b>Declare</b> these things; <b>exhort</b> and rebuke with all <b>authority</b>. Let no one <b>disregard</b> you.

<b>Remind</b> them to be submissive to <b>rulers</b> and <b>authorities</b>, to be <b>obedient</b>, to be <b>ready</b> for every good work, 2 to <b>speak</b> evil of no one, to avoid <b>quarreling</b>, to be <b>gentle</b>, and to show <b>perfect</b> <b>courtesy</b> toward all people. 3 For we <b>ourselves</b> <b>were</b> once foolish, disobedient, <b>led</b> <b>astray</b>, slaves to <b>various</b> passions and <b>pleasures</b>, <b>passing</b> our <b>days</b> in <b>malice</b> and <b>envy</b>, <b>hated</b> by <b>others</b> and <b>hating</b> one <b>another</b>. 4 But when the goodness and <b>loving</b> <b>kindness</b> of God our Savior appeared, 5 he <b>saved</b> us, not because of works <b>done</b> by us in <b>righteousness</b>, but according to his own <b>mercy</b>, by the <b>washing</b> of <b>regeneration</b> and <b>renewal</b> of the Holy Spirit, 6 <b>whom</b> he <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> on us <b>richly</b> through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that <b>being</b> <b>justified</b> by his grace we might become <b>heirs</b> according to the hope of eternal life. 8 The <b>saying</b> is trustworthy, and I want you to <b>insist</b> on these things, so that those who have <b>believed</b> in God may be <b>careful</b> to devote themselves to good works. These things are <b>excellent</b> and <b>profitable</b> for people. 9 But avoid foolish <b>controversies</b>, <b>genealogies</b>, <b>dissensions</b>, and <b>quarrels</b> about the <b>law</b>, for they are <b>unprofitable</b> and <b>worthless</b>. 10 As for a person who <b>stirs</b> <b>up</b> <b>division</b>, <b>after</b> <b>warning</b> him once and <b>then</b> <b>twice</b>, have nothing more to do with him, 11 knowing that <b>such</b> a person is <b>warped</b> and <b>sinful</b>; he is <b>self-condemned</b>.

12 When I send <b>Artemas</b> or <b>Tychicus</b> to you, do your best to <b>come</b> to me at <b>Nicopolis</b>, for I have <b>decided</b> to <b>spend</b> the <b>winter</b> there. 13 Do your best to <b>speed</b> <b>Zenas</b> the <b>lawyer</b> and <b>Apollos</b> on their <b>way</b>; <b>see</b> that they <b>lack</b> nothing. 14 And let our people <b>learn</b> to devote themselves to good works, so as to <b>help</b> <b>cases</b> of <b>urgent</b> <b>need</b>, and not be <b>unfruitful</b>.

15 All who are with me send greetings to you. <b>Greet</b> those who love us in the faith.

Grace be with you all. 
<h2>Philemon</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
1 Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and <b>Timothy</b> our brother,

To Philemon our beloved fellow <b>worker</b> 2 and <b>Apphia</b> our <b>sister</b> and <b>Archippus</b> our fellow <b>soldier</b>, and the <b>church</b> in your <b>house</b>:

3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4 I <b>thank</b> my God always when I <b>remember</b> you in my prayers, 5 because I <b>hear</b> of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints, 6 and I <b>pray</b> that the <b>sharing</b> of your faith may become <b>effective</b> for the <b>full</b> knowledge of every good <b>thing</b> that is in us for the sake of Christ. 7 For I have <b>derived</b> much <b>joy</b> and <b>comfort</b> from your love, my brother, because the <b>hearts</b> of the saints have been <b>refreshed</b> through you.

8 <b>Accordingly</b>, <b>though</b> I am <b>bold</b> <b>enough</b> in Christ to command you to do what is <b>required</b>, 9 <b>yet</b> for love’s sake I <b>prefer</b> to appeal to you—I, Paul, an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus— 10 I appeal to you for my child, <b>Onesimus</b>, <b>whose</b> father I <b>became</b> in my imprisonment. 11 (<b>Formerly</b> he was <b>useless</b> to you, but now he is <b>indeed</b> <b>useful</b> to you and to me.) 12 I am sending him back to you, sending my <b>very</b> heart. 13 I would have been <b>glad</b> to <b>keep</b> him with me, in order that he might <b>serve</b> me on your <b>behalf</b> <b>during</b> my imprisonment for the <b>gospel</b>, 14 but I <b>preferred</b> to do nothing <b>without</b> your <b>consent</b> in order that your goodness might not be by <b>compulsion</b> but of your own <b>accord</b>. 15 For this <b>perhaps</b> is why he was <b>parted</b> from you for a <b>while</b>, that you might have him back <b>forever</b>, 16 no <b>longer</b> as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother—especially to me, but <b>how</b> much more to you, both in the <b>flesh</b> and in the Lord.

17 So if you <b>consider</b> me your <b>partner</b>, receive him as you would receive me. 18 If he has <b>wronged</b> you at all, or <b>owes</b> you <b>anything</b>, charge that to my <b>account</b>. 19 I, Paul, write this with my own <b>hand</b>: I will <b>repay</b> it—to say nothing of your <b>owing</b> me even your own <b>self</b>. 20 <b>Yes</b>, brother, I want <b>some</b> <b>benefit</b> from you in the Lord. <b>Refresh</b> my heart in Christ.

21 <b>Confident</b> of your <b>obedience</b>, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 22 At the <b>same</b> time, <b>prepare</b> a <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> for me, for I am <b>hoping</b> that through your prayers I will be <b>graciously</b> <b>given</b> to you.

23 <b>Epaphras</b>, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, <b>sends</b> greetings to you, 24 and so do <b>Mark</b>, <b>Aristarchus</b>, <b>Demas</b>, and <b>Luke</b>, my fellow <b>workers</b>.

25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
