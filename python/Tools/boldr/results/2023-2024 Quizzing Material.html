Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,

To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

Grace to you and peace.

2 We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly <b>mentioning</b> you in our prayers, 3 <b>remembering</b> before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. 4 For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has <b>chosen</b> you, 5 because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full <b>conviction</b>. You know what kind of men we <b>proved</b> to be among you for your sake. 6 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, 7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 8 For not only has the word of the Lord <b>sounded</b> forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth <b>everywhere</b>, so that we need not say anything. 9 For they themselves <b>report</b> concerning us the kind of <b>reception</b> we had among you, and how you turned to God from <b>idols</b> to serve the living and true God, 10 and to <b>wait</b> for his Son from heaven, whom he <b>raised</b> from the dead, Jesus who <b>delivers</b> us from the wrath to come. 
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
2 
For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not in vain. 2 But though we had already suffered and been <b>shamefully</b> <b>treated</b> at <b>Philippi</b>, as you know, we had <b>boldness</b> in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the <b>midst</b> of much <b>conflict</b>. 3 For our appeal does not <b>spring</b> from <b>error</b> or impurity or any <b>attempt</b> to deceive, 4 but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please man, but to please God who <b>tests</b> our hearts. 5 For we never came with words of <b>flattery</b>, as you know, nor with a <b>pretext</b> for <b>greed</b>—God is <b>witness</b>. 6 Nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, though we could have made <b>demands</b> as <b>apostles</b> of Christ. 7 But we were gentle among you, like a <b>nursing</b> mother <b>taking</b> care of her own children. 8 So, being <b>affectionately</b> <b>desirous</b> of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own <b>selves</b>, because you had become very <b>dear</b> to us.

9 For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. 10 You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers. 11 For you know how, like a father with his children, 12 we <b>exhorted</b> each one of you and <b>encouraged</b> you and charged you to walk in a <b>manner</b> worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.

13 And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you <b>accepted</b> it not as the word of men but as what it <b>really</b> is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers. 14 For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in <b>Judea</b>. For you suffered the same things from your own <b>countrymen</b> as they did from the <b>Jews</b>, 15 who <b>killed</b> both the Lord Jesus and the <b>prophets</b>, and <b>drove</b> us out, and <b>displease</b> God and oppose all <b>mankind</b> 16 by <b>hindering</b> us from <b>speaking</b> to the Gentiles that they might be saved—so as always to <b>fill</b> up the <b>measure</b> of their sins. But wrath has come upon them at last!

17 But since we were <b>torn</b> away from you, brothers, for a <b>short</b> time, in person not in heart, we <b>endeavored</b> the more <b>eagerly</b> and with great desire to see you face to face, 18 because we <b>wanted</b> to come to you—I, Paul, again and again—but Satan <b>hindered</b> us. 19 For what is our hope or joy or crown of <b>boasting</b> before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? 20 For you are our glory and joy. 
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we were willing to be left <b>behind</b> at <b>Athens</b> alone, 2 and we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s <b>coworker</b> in the gospel of Christ, to establish and exhort you in your faith, 3 that no one be <b>moved</b> by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined for this. 4 For when we were with you, we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction, just as it has come to <b>pass</b>, and just as you know. 5 For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to learn about your faith, for fear that <b>somehow</b> the <b>tempter</b> had <b>tempted</b> you and our labor would be in vain.

6 But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us the good <b>news</b> of your faith and love and <b>reported</b> that you always remember us <b>kindly</b> and long to see us, as we long to see you— 7 for this reason, brothers, in all our <b>distress</b> and affliction we have been <b>comforted</b> about you through your faith. 8 For now we live, if you are standing fast in the Lord. 9 For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you, for all the joy that we <b>feel</b> for your sake before our God, 10 as we pray <b>most</b> earnestly night and day that we may see you face to face and <b>supply</b> what is <b>lacking</b> in your faith?

11 Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you, 12 and may the Lord make you <b>increase</b> and <b>abound</b> in love for one another and for all, as we do for you, 13 so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
4 
Finally, then, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you are doing, that you do so more and more. 2 For you know what <b>instructions</b> we gave you through the Lord Jesus. 3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from <b>sexual</b> <b>immorality</b>; 4 that each one of you know how to <b>control</b> his own body in holiness and honor, 5 not in the <b>passion</b> of <b>lust</b> like the Gentiles who do not know God; 6 that no one <b>transgress</b> and <b>wrong</b> his brother in this <b>matter</b>, because the Lord is an <b>avenger</b> in all these things, as we told you beforehand and <b>solemnly</b> <b>warned</b> you. 7 For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness. 8 Therefore <b>whoever</b> disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.

9 Now concerning <b>brotherly</b> love you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another, 10 for that indeed is what you are doing to all the brothers <b>throughout</b> Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to do this more and more, 11 and to <b>aspire</b> to live quietly, and to mind your own <b>affairs</b>, and to work with your hands, as we <b>instructed</b> you, 12 so that you may walk <b>properly</b> before outsiders and be <b>dependent</b> on no one.

13 But we do not want you to be <b>uninformed</b>, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not <b>grieve</b> as others do who have no hope. 14 For since we believe that Jesus died and <b>rose</b> again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. 15 For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not <b>precede</b> those who have fallen asleep. 16 For the Lord himself will <b>descend</b> from heaven with a <b>cry</b> of command, with the <b>voice</b> of an <b>archangel</b>, and with the sound of the <b>trumpet</b> of God. And the dead in Christ will <b>rise</b> first. 17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will be <b>caught</b> up together with them in the <b>clouds</b> to <b>meet</b> the Lord in the <b>air</b>, and so we will always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore encourage one another with these words. 
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
5 
Now concerning the times and the <b>seasons</b>, brothers, you have no need to have anything <b>written</b> to you. 2 For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 3 While people are saying, “There is peace and <b>security</b>,” then <b>sudden</b> destruction will come upon them as labor <b>pains</b> come upon a <b>pregnant</b> woman, and they will not escape. 4 But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to <b>surprise</b> you like a thief. 5 For you are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness. 6 So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. 7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night. 8 But since we <b>belong</b> to the day, let us be sober, having put on the <b>breastplate</b> of faith and love, and for a <b>helmet</b> the hope of salvation. 9 For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 10 who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him. 11 Therefore encourage one another and <b>build</b> one another up, just as you are doing.

12 We ask you, brothers, to <b>respect</b> those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, 13 and to <b>esteem</b> them very <b>highly</b> in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 14 And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the <b>fainthearted</b>, help the weak, be <b>patient</b> with them all. 15 See that no one <b>repays</b> anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. 16 <b>Rejoice</b> always, 17 pray without <b>ceasing</b>, 18 give thanks in all <b>circumstances</b>; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. 19 Do not <b>quench</b> the Spirit. 20 Do not despise prophecies, 21 but <b>test</b> everything; hold fast what is good. 22 Abstain from every <b>form</b> of evil.

23 Now may the God of peace himself <b>sanctify</b> you <b>completely</b>, and may your whole spirit and <b>soul</b> and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 24 He who calls you is faithful; he will <b>surely</b> do it.

25 Brothers, pray for us.

26 Greet all the brothers with a holy <b>kiss</b>.

27 I put you under <b>oath</b> before the Lord to have this letter <b>read</b> to all the brothers.

28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,

To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3 We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is right, because your faith is <b>growing</b> <b>abundantly</b>, and the love of every one of you for one another is <b>increasing</b>. 4 Therefore we ourselves <b>boast</b> about you in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring.

5 This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering— 6 since indeed God <b>considers</b> it just to repay with affliction those who <b>afflict</b> you, 7 and to grant <b>relief</b> to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his <b>mighty</b> angels 8 in <b>flaming</b> <b>fire</b>, <b>inflicting</b> <b>vengeance</b> on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 9 They will suffer the <b>punishment</b> of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, 10 when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be <b>marveled</b> at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed. 11 To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every <b>resolve</b> for good and every work of faith by his power, 12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
2 
Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being <b>gathered</b> together to him, we ask you, brothers, 2 not to be <b>quickly</b> <b>shaken</b> in mind or <b>alarmed</b>, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter <b>seeming</b> to be from us, to the <b>effect</b> that the day of the Lord has come. 3 Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the <b>rebellion</b> comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, 4 who <b>opposes</b> and <b>exalts</b> himself against every <b>so-called</b> god or <b>object</b> of <b>worship</b>, so that he <b>takes</b> his <b>seat</b> in the <b>temple</b> of God, <b>proclaiming</b> himself to be God. 5 Do you not remember that when I was <b>still</b> with you I told you these things? 6 And you know what is <b>restraining</b> him now so that he may be revealed in his time. 7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now <b>restrains</b> it will do so until he is out of the way. 8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will <b>kill</b> with the <b>breath</b> of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. 9 The coming of the lawless one is by the <b>activity</b> of Satan with all power and false <b>signs</b> and <b>wonders</b>, 10 and with all wicked <b>deception</b> for those who are <b>perishing</b>, because they <b>refused</b> to love the truth and so be saved. 11 Therefore God sends them a <b>strong</b> <b>delusion</b>, so that they may believe what is false, 12 in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in <b>unrighteousness</b>.

13 But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God <b>chose</b> you as the <b>firstfruits</b> to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and <b>belief</b> in the truth. 14 To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 15 So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the <b>traditions</b> that you were taught by us, either by our spoken word or by our letter.

16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, 17 comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word. 
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
3 
Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may speed <b>ahead</b> and be <b>honored</b>, as happened among you, 2 and that we may be <b>delivered</b> from wicked and evil men. For not all have faith. 3 But the Lord is faithful. He will establish you and guard you against the evil one. 4 And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things that we command. 5 May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.

6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from any brother who is <b>walking</b> in idleness and not in accord with the <b>tradition</b> that you received from us. 7 For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with you, 8 nor did we eat anyone’s <b>bread</b> without <b>paying</b> for it, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you. 9 It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate. 10 For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat. 11 For we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not <b>busy</b> at work, but busybodies. 12 Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to <b>earn</b> their own living.

13 As for you, brothers, do not <b>grow</b> <b>weary</b> in doing good. 14 If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take <b>note</b> of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. 15 Do not regard him as an <b>enemy</b>, but <b>warn</b> him as a brother.

16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all.

17 I, Paul, write this <b>greeting</b> with my own hand. This is the <b>sign</b> of <b>genuineness</b> in every letter of <b>mine</b>; it is the way I write. 18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. 
<h2>1Timothy</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
1 
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,

2 To Timothy, my true child in the faith:

Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3 As I <b>urged</b> you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine, 4 nor to devote themselves to myths and <b>endless</b> genealogies, which <b>promote</b> <b>speculations</b> rather than the <b>stewardship</b> from God that is by faith. 5 The aim of our charge is love that <b>issues</b> from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. 6 Certain persons, by <b>swerving</b> from these, have wandered away into vain <b>discussion</b>, 7 <b>desiring</b> to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident <b>assertions</b>.

8 Now we know that the law is good, if one <b>uses</b> it <b>lawfully</b>, 9 understanding this, that the law is not laid <b>down</b> for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the <b>ungodly</b> and sinners, for the unholy and <b>profane</b>, for those who <b>strike</b> their <b>fathers</b> and mothers, for <b>murderers</b>, 10 the <b>sexually</b> <b>immoral</b>, men who practice <b>homosexuality</b>, <b>enslavers</b>, liars, <b>perjurers</b>, and <b>whatever</b> <b>else</b> is <b>contrary</b> to sound doctrine, 11 in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.

12 I thank him who has given me <b>strength</b>, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he <b>judged</b> me faithful, <b>appointing</b> me to his service, 13 though formerly I was a <b>blasphemer</b>, <b>persecutor</b>, and <b>insolent</b> opponent. But I received mercy because I had <b>acted</b> <b>ignorantly</b> in <b>unbelief</b>, 14 and the grace of our Lord <b>overflowed</b> for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 15 The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. 16 But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. 17 To the King of the ages, <b>immortal</b>, <b>invisible</b>, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

18 This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies <b>previously</b> made about you, that by them you may <b>wage</b> the good <b>warfare</b>, 19 <b>holding</b> faith and a good conscience. By <b>rejecting</b> this, some have made <b>shipwreck</b> of their faith, 20 among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have <b>handed</b> over to Satan that they may learn not to <b>blaspheme</b>. 
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
2 
First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, <b>intercessions</b>, and <b>thanksgivings</b> be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in <b>high</b> <b>positions</b>, that we may lead a <b>peaceful</b> and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. 3 This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, 4 who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God, and there is one <b>mediator</b> <b>between</b> God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 6 who gave himself as a <b>ransom</b> for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time. 7 For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not <b>lying</b>), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

8 I desire then that in every <b>place</b> the men should pray, <b>lifting</b> holy hands without <b>anger</b> or quarreling; 9 likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable <b>apparel</b>, with <b>modesty</b> and self-control, not with <b>braided</b> <b>hair</b> and gold or <b>pearls</b> or <b>costly</b> <b>attire</b>, 10 but with what is proper for women who profess godliness—with good works. 11 Let a woman learn quietly with all <b>submissiveness</b>. 12 I do not <b>permit</b> a woman to teach or to <b>exercise</b> authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. 13 For Adam was <b>formed</b> first, then <b>Eve</b>; 14 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a <b>transgressor</b>. 15 Yet she will be saved through <b>childbearing</b>—if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control. 
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
3 
The saying is trustworthy: If anyone <b>aspires</b> to the <b>office</b> of overseer, he desires a <b>noble</b> <b>task</b>. 2 Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 3 not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 4 He must manage his own household well, with all dignity <b>keeping</b> his children submissive, 5 for if <b>someone</b> does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God’s church? 6 He must not be a <b>recent</b> <b>convert</b>, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. 7 <b>Moreover</b>, he must be well <b>thought</b> of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into <b>disgrace</b>, into a snare of the devil.

8 Deacons likewise must be dignified, not <b>double-tongued</b>, not <b>addicted</b> to much wine, not greedy for <b>dishonest</b> gain. 9 They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 10 And let them also be <b>tested</b> first; then let them serve as deacons if they <b>prove</b> themselves blameless. 11 Their <b>wives</b> likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things. 12 Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, <b>managing</b> their children and their own households well. 13 For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.

14 I hope to come to you soon, but I am <b>writing</b> these things to you so that, 15 if I <b>delay</b>, you may know how one ought to <b>behave</b> in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a <b>pillar</b> and <b>buttress</b> of the truth. 16 Great indeed, we <b>confess</b>, is the mystery of godliness:

He was manifested in the flesh,

<b>vindicated</b> by the Spirit,

seen by angels,

proclaimed among the <b>nations</b>,

believed on in the world,

<b>taken</b> up in glory.

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
4 
Now the Spirit <b>expressly</b> says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to <b>deceitful</b> <b>spirits</b> and <b>teachings</b> of <b>demons</b>, 2 through the <b>insincerity</b> of liars whose consciences are <b>seared</b>, 3 who <b>forbid</b> <b>marriage</b> and <b>require</b> <b>abstinence</b> from <b>foods</b> that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be <b>rejected</b> if it is received with thanksgiving, 5 for it is made holy by the word of God and <b>prayer</b>.

6 If you put these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being <b>trained</b> in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed. 7 Have nothing to do with irreverent, <b>silly</b> myths. Rather train yourself for godliness; 8 for while <b>bodily</b> training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it <b>holds</b> promise for the present life and also for the life to come. 9 The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance. 10 For to this end we toil and <b>strive</b>, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.

11 Command and teach these things. 12 Let no one despise you for your <b>youth</b>, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. 13 Until I come, devote yourself to the <b>public</b> <b>reading</b> of Scripture, to <b>exhortation</b>, to teaching. 14 Do not <b>neglect</b> the gift you have, which was given you by <b>prophecy</b> when the <b>council</b> of elders laid their hands on you. 15 Practice these things, <b>immerse</b> yourself in them, so that all may see your <b>progress</b>. 16 Keep a <b>close</b> <b>watch</b> on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers. 
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
5 
Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father, younger men as brothers, 2 older women as mothers, younger women as <b>sisters</b>, in all purity.

3 Honor widows who are truly widows. 4 But if a widow has children or <b>grandchildren</b>, let them first learn to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God. 5 She who is truly a widow, left all alone, has set her hope on God and <b>continues</b> in supplications and prayers night and day, 6 but she who is <b>self-indulgent</b> is dead even while she lives. 7 Command these things as well, so that they may be without reproach. 8 But if anyone does not <b>provide</b> for his relatives, and especially for <b>members</b> of his household, he has <b>denied</b> the faith and is worse than an <b>unbeliever</b>.

9 Let a widow be <b>enrolled</b> if she is not <b>less</b> than <b>sixty</b> <b>years</b> of age, having been the wife of one husband, 10 and having a <b>reputation</b> for good works: if she has brought up children, has <b>shown</b> <b>hospitality</b>, has <b>washed</b> the <b>feet</b> of the saints, has <b>cared</b> for the afflicted, and has <b>devoted</b> <b>herself</b> to every good work. 11 But <b>refuse</b> to <b>enroll</b> younger widows, for when their passions <b>draw</b> them away from Christ, they desire to marry 12 and so <b>incur</b> condemnation for having <b>abandoned</b> their <b>former</b> faith. 13 <b>Besides</b> that, they learn to be idlers, going about from house to house, and not only idlers, but also <b>gossips</b> and busybodies, saying what they should not. 14 So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the <b>adversary</b> no <b>occasion</b> for slander. 15 For some have already <b>strayed</b> after Satan. 16 If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her care for them. Let the church not be burdened, so that it may care for those who are truly widows.

17 Let the elders who <b>rule</b> well be considered worthy of <b>double</b> honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. 18 For the Scripture says, “You <b>shall</b> not <b>muzzle</b> an <b>ox</b> when it <b>treads</b> out the <b>grain</b>,” and, “The <b>laborer</b> <b>deserves</b> his <b>wages</b>.” 19 Do not <b>admit</b> a charge against an <b>elder</b> <b>except</b> on the evidence of two or <b>three</b> witnesses. 20 As for those who persist in <b>sin</b>, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the <b>rest</b> may stand in fear. 21 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without <b>prejudging</b>, doing nothing from <b>partiality</b>. 22 Do not be <b>hasty</b> in the laying on of hands, nor take <b>part</b> in the sins of others; keep yourself pure. 23 (No longer drink only <b>water</b>, but use a <b>little</b> wine for the sake of your <b>stomach</b> and your <b>frequent</b> <b>ailments</b>.) 24 The sins of some people are conspicuous, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others <b>appear</b> later. 25 So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that are not cannot remain <b>hidden</b>. 
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
6 
Let all who are under a <b>yoke</b> as bondservants regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled. 2 Those who have believing masters must not be <b>disrespectful</b> on the <b>ground</b> that they are brothers; rather they must serve all the <b>better</b> since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved.

Teach and urge these things. 3 If anyone <b>teaches</b> a different doctrine and does not <b>agree</b> with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness, 4 he is puffed up with conceit and <b>understands</b> nothing. He has an <b>unhealthy</b> craving for <b>controversy</b> and for quarrels about words, which <b>produce</b> envy, <b>dissension</b>, slander, evil <b>suspicions</b>, 5 and <b>constant</b> <b>friction</b> among people who are <b>depraved</b> in mind and <b>deprived</b> of the truth, <b>imagining</b> that godliness is a <b>means</b> of gain. 6 But godliness with <b>contentment</b> is great gain, 7 for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. 8 But if we have <b>food</b> and <b>clothing</b>, with these we will be <b>content</b>. 9 But those who desire to be rich fall into <b>temptation</b>, into a snare, into many <b>senseless</b> and <b>harmful</b> desires that <b>plunge</b> people into <b>ruin</b> and destruction. 10 For the love of money is a <b>root</b> of all <b>kinds</b> of <b>evils</b>. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and <b>pierced</b> themselves with many <b>pangs</b>.

11 But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. 12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 13 I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before <b>Pontius</b> <b>Pilate</b> made the good confession, 14 to keep the <b>commandment</b> <b>unstained</b> and <b>free</b> from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 which he will display at the proper time—he who is the blessed and only <b>Sovereign</b>, the King of kings and Lord of <b>lords</b>, 16 who alone has immortality, who dwells in <b>unapproachable</b> light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal <b>dominion</b>. Amen.

17 As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be <b>haughty</b>, nor to set their <b>hopes</b> on the <b>uncertainty</b> of <b>riches</b>, but on God, who richly <b>provides</b> us with everything to <b>enjoy</b>. 18 They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be <b>generous</b> and ready to share, 19 <b>thus</b> <b>storing</b> up <b>treasure</b> for themselves as a good foundation for the <b>future</b>, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.

20 O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you. Avoid the irreverent babble and <b>contradictions</b> of what is <b>falsely</b> called “knowledge,” 21 for by <b>professing</b> it some have swerved from the faith.

Grace be with you.
<h2>2Timothy</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
1 
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus,

2 To Timothy, my beloved child:

Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

3 I thank God whom I serve, as did my <b>ancestors</b>, with a clear conscience, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day. 4 As I remember your <b>tears</b>, I long to see you, that I may be <b>filled</b> with joy. 5 I am <b>reminded</b> of your sincere faith, a faith that <b>dwelt</b> first in your <b>grandmother</b> <b>Lois</b> and your mother <b>Eunice</b> and now, I am <b>sure</b>, dwells in you as well. 6 For this reason I remind you to <b>fan</b> into <b>flame</b> the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands, 7 for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.

8 Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God, 9 who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own <b>purpose</b> and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, 10 and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who <b>abolished</b> <b>death</b> and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, 11 for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher, 12 which is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am <b>convinced</b> that he is able to guard until that day what has been entrusted to me. 13 <b>Follow</b> the <b>pattern</b> of the sound words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 14 By the Holy Spirit who dwells <b>within</b> us, guard the good deposit entrusted to you.

15 You are aware that all who are in <b>Asia</b> turned away from me, among whom are <b>Phygelus</b> and <b>Hermogenes</b>. 16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he <b>often</b> refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains, 17 but when he <b>arrived</b> in <b>Rome</b> he <b>searched</b> for me earnestly and <b>found</b> me— 18 may the Lord grant him to <b>find</b> mercy from the Lord on that day!—and you well know all the service he <b>rendered</b> at Ephesus. 
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
2 
You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 2 and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. 3 Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 4 No soldier <b>gets</b> <b>entangled</b> in <b>civilian</b> <b>pursuits</b>, since his aim is to please the one who <b>enlisted</b> him. 5 An <b>athlete</b> is not <b>crowned</b> unless he <b>competes</b> according to the rules. 6 It is the <b>hard-<b>working</b></b> <b>farmer</b> who ought to have the first share of the <b>crops</b>. 7 <b>Think</b> over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.

8 Remember Jesus Christ, <b>risen</b> from the dead, the <b>offspring</b> of <b>David</b>, as <b>preached</b> in my gospel, 9 for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a <b>criminal</b>. But the word of God is not bound! 10 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 11 The saying is trustworthy, for:

If we have died with him, we will also live with him;

12 	if we endure, we will also <b>reign</b> with him;

if we deny him, he also will deny us;

13 	if we are <b>faithless</b>, he <b>remains</b> faithful—

for he cannot deny himself.

14 Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to <b>quarrel</b> about words, which does no good, but only <b>ruins</b> the hearers. 15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, <b>rightly</b> <b>handling</b> the word of truth. 16 But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, 17 and their <b>talk</b> will <b>spread</b> like <b>gangrene</b>. Among them are Hymenaeus and <b>Philetus</b>, 18 who have swerved from the truth, saying that the <b>resurrection</b> has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some. 19 But God’s firm foundation <b>stands</b>, <b>bearing</b> this <b>seal</b>: “The Lord <b>knows</b> those who are his,” and, “Let everyone who <b>names</b> the name of the Lord depart from <b>iniquity</b>.”

20 Now in a great house there are not only <b>vessels</b> of gold and <b>silver</b> but also of <b>wood</b> and <b>clay</b>, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. 21 Therefore, if anyone <b>cleanses</b> himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a <b>vessel</b> for honorable use, set <b>apart</b> as holy, useful to the <b>master</b> of the house, ready for every good work.

22 So flee <b>youthful</b> passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, <b>along</b> with those who <b>call</b> on the Lord from a pure heart. 23 Have nothing to do with foolish, <b>ignorant</b> controversies; you know that they <b>breed</b> quarrels. 24 And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, <b>patiently</b> enduring evil, 25 <b>correcting</b> his <b>opponents</b> with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them <b>repentance</b> <b>leading</b> to a knowledge of the truth, 26 and they may come to their <b>senses</b> and escape from the snare of the devil, after being <b>captured</b> by him to do his will. 
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
3 
But <b>understand</b> this, that in the last days there will come times of <b>difficulty</b>. 2 For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, <b>proud</b>, arrogant, <b>abusive</b>, disobedient to their parents, <b>ungrateful</b>, unholy, 3 <b>heartless</b>, <b>unappeasable</b>, <b>slanderous</b>, without self-control, <b>brutal</b>, not loving good, 4 <b>treacherous</b>, <b>reckless</b>, <b>swollen</b> with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5 having the appearance of godliness, but <b>denying</b> <b>its</b> power. Avoid such people. 6 For among them are those who <b>creep</b> into households and <b>capture</b> weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, 7 always <b>learning</b> and never able to <b>arrive</b> at a knowledge of the truth. 8 Just as <b>Jannes</b> and <b>Jambres</b> opposed <b>Moses</b>, so these men also oppose the truth, men <b>corrupted</b> in mind and <b>disqualified</b> <b>regarding</b> the faith. 9 But they will not get very <b>far</b>, for their <b>folly</b> will be <b>plain</b> to all, as was that of those two men.

10 You, <b>however</b>, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, 11 my persecutions and <b>sufferings</b> that happened to me at <b>Antioch</b>, at <b>Iconium</b>, and at <b>Lystra</b>—which persecutions I <b>endured</b>; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. 12 Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be <b>persecuted</b>, 13 while evil people and <b>impostors</b> will <b>go</b> on from <b>bad</b> to worse, <b>deceiving</b> and being deceived. 14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have <b>firmly</b> believed, knowing from whom you learned it 15 and how from <b>childhood</b> you have been <b>acquainted</b> with the <b>sacred</b> <b>writings</b>, which are able to make you <b>wise</b> for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 16 All Scripture is <b>breathed</b> out by God and profitable for teaching, for <b>reproof</b>, for <b>correction</b>, and for training in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, <b>equipped</b> for every good work. 
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
4 
I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: 2 <b>preach</b> the word; be ready in season and out of season; <b>reprove</b>, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. 3 For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having <b>itching</b> <b>ears</b> they will <b>accumulate</b> for themselves teachers to <b>suit</b> their own passions, 4 and will turn away from <b>listening</b> to the truth and <b>wander</b> <b>off</b> into myths. 5 As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an <b>evangelist</b>, fulfill your ministry.

6 For I am already being poured out as a drink <b>offering</b>, and the time of my <b>departure</b> has come. 7 I have <b>fought</b> the good fight, I have <b>finished</b> the <b>race</b>, I have kept the faith. 8 <b>Henceforth</b> there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will <b>award</b> to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.

9 Do your best to come to me soon. 10 For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to <b>Thessalonica</b>. <b>Crescens</b> has gone to <b>Galatia</b>, Titus to <b>Dalmatia</b>. 11 Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me for ministry. 12 Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. 13 When you come, bring the <b>cloak</b> that I left with <b>Carpus</b> at <b>Troas</b>, also the <b>books</b>, and above all the <b>parchments</b>. 14 Alexander the <b>coppersmith</b> did me great <b>harm</b>; the Lord will repay him according to his <b>deeds</b>. 15 <b>Beware</b> of him yourself, for he <b>strongly</b> opposed our message. 16 At my first <b>defense</b> no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. May it not be charged against them! 17 But the Lord <b>stood</b> by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the <b>lion</b>’s mouth. 18 The Lord will <b>rescue</b> me from every evil <b>deed</b> and bring me <b>safely</b> into his <b>heavenly</b> kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

19 Greet <b>Prisca</b> and <b>Aquila</b>, and the household of Onesiphorus. 20 <b>Erastus</b> remained at <b>Corinth</b>, and I left <b>Trophimus</b>, who was <b>ill</b>, at <b>Miletus</b>. 21 Do your best to come before winter. <b>Eubulus</b> sends greetings to you, as do <b>Pudens</b> and <b>Linus</b> and <b>Claudia</b> and all the brothers.

22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
<h2>Titus</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness, 2 in hope of eternal life, which God, who never <b>lies</b>, <b>promised</b> before the ages began 3 and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior;

4 To Titus, my true child in a <b>common</b> faith:

Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

5 This is why I left you in <b>Crete</b>, so that you might put what remained into order, and <b>appoint</b> elders in every <b>town</b> as I <b>directed</b> you— 6 if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not <b>open</b> to the charge of <b>debauchery</b> or <b>insubordination</b>. 7 For an overseer, as God’s <b>steward</b>, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or <b>quick-tempered</b> or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, 8 but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and <b>disciplined</b>. 9 He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give <b>instruction</b> in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who <b>contradict</b> it.

10 For there are many who are <b>insubordinate</b>, <b>empty</b> <b>talkers</b> and <b>deceivers</b>, especially those of the <b>circumcision</b> <b>party</b>. 11 They must be <b>silenced</b>, since they are upsetting whole <b>families</b> by teaching for <b>shameful</b> gain what they ought not to teach. 12 One of the Cretans, a <b>prophet</b> of their own, <b>said</b>, “Cretans are always liars, evil <b>beasts</b>, <b>lazy</b> <b>gluttons</b>.” 13 This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them <b>sharply</b>, that they may be sound in the faith, 14 not devoting themselves to <b>Jewish</b> myths and the <b>commands</b> of people who turn away from the truth. 15 To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and <b>unbelieving</b>, nothing is pure; but both their <b>minds</b> and their consciences are defiled. 16 They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are <b>detestable</b>, disobedient, <b>unfit</b> for any good work. 
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
2 
But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine. 2 Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness. 3 Older women likewise are to be <b>reverent</b> in <b>behavior</b>, not slanderers or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good, 4 and so train the <b>young</b> women to love their husbands and children, 5 to be self-controlled, pure, working at <b>home</b>, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled. 6 Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled. 7 Show yourself in all <b>respects</b> to be a <b>model</b> of good works, and in your teaching show <b>integrity</b>, dignity, 8 and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to <b>shame</b>, having nothing evil to say about us. 9 Bondservants are to be submissive to their own masters in everything; they are to be <b>well-pleasing</b>, not <b>argumentative</b>, 10 not <b>pilfering</b>, but <b>showing</b> all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.

11 For the grace of God has appeared, <b>bringing</b> salvation for all people, 12 training us to <b>renounce</b> ungodliness and <b>worldly</b> passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, 13 <b>waiting</b> for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 14 who gave himself for us to <b>redeem</b> us from all lawlessness and to <b>purify</b> for himself a people for his own <b>possession</b> who are <b>zealous</b> for good works.

15 Declare these things; exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one <b>disregard</b> you. 
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
3 
Remind them to be submissive to <b>rulers</b> and <b>authorities</b>, to be <b>obedient</b>, to be ready for every good work, 2 to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect <b>courtesy</b> toward all people. 3 For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and <b>pleasures</b>, <b>passing</b> our days in <b>malice</b> and envy, <b>hated</b> by others and <b>hating</b> one another. 4 But when the goodness and loving <b>kindness</b> of God our Savior appeared, 5 he saved us, not because of works <b>done</b> by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the <b>washing</b> of <b>regeneration</b> and <b>renewal</b> of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that being <b>justified</b> by his grace we might become <b>heirs</b> according to the hope of eternal life. 8 The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to <b>insist</b> on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be <b>careful</b> to devote themselves to good works. These things are <b>excellent</b> and profitable for people. 9 But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, <b>dissensions</b>, and quarrels about the law, for they are <b>unprofitable</b> and <b>worthless</b>. 10 As for a person who <b>stirs</b> up <b>division</b>, after <b>warning</b> him once and then <b>twice</b>, have nothing more to do with him, 11 knowing that such a person is <b>warped</b> and <b>sinful</b>; he is <b>self-condemned</b>.

12 When I send <b>Artemas</b> or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at <b>Nicopolis</b>, for I have <b>decided</b> to <b>spend</b> the winter there. 13 Do your best to speed <b>Zenas</b> the <b>lawyer</b> and <b>Apollos</b> on their way; see that they <b>lack</b> nothing. 14 And let our people learn to devote themselves to good works, so as to help <b>cases</b> of <b>urgent</b> need, and not be <b>unfruitful</b>.

15 All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith.

Grace be with you all. 
<h2>Philemon</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
1 Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,

To Philemon our beloved fellow worker 2 and <b>Apphia</b> our <b>sister</b> and <b>Archippus</b> our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:

3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

4 I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, 5 because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints, 6 and I pray that the <b>sharing</b> of your faith may become <b>effective</b> for the full knowledge of every good <b>thing</b> that is in us for the sake of Christ. 7 For I have <b>derived</b> much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.

8 <b>Accordingly</b>, though I am <b>bold</b> <b>enough</b> in Christ to command you to do what is <b>required</b>, 9 yet for love’s sake I <b>prefer</b> to appeal to you—I, Paul, an <b>old</b> man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus— 10 I appeal to you for my child, <b>Onesimus</b>, whose father I became in my imprisonment. 11 (Formerly he was <b>useless</b> to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) 12 I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. 13 I would have been <b>glad</b> to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your <b>behalf</b> <b>during</b> my imprisonment for the gospel, 14 but I <b>preferred</b> to do nothing without your <b>consent</b> in order that your goodness might not be by <b>compulsion</b> but of your own accord. 15 For this perhaps is why he was <b>parted</b> from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, 16 no longer as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.

17 So if you <b>consider</b> me your <b>partner</b>, receive him as you would receive me. 18 If he has <b>wronged</b> you at all, or <b>owes</b> you anything, charge that to my <b>account</b>. 19 I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of your <b>owing</b> me even your own self. 20 <b>Yes</b>, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. <b>Refresh</b> my heart in Christ.

21 Confident of your <b>obedience</b>, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 22 At the same time, <b>prepare</b> a <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> for me, for I am <b>hoping</b> that through your prayers I will be <b>graciously</b> given to you.

23 <b>Epaphras</b>, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, 24 and so do Mark, <b>Aristarchus</b>, Demas, and Luke, my fellow <b>workers</b>.

25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
